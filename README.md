# Brainrust
 BrainRust is a BrainF superset made in Rust!

 It has new commands such as `*` which prints a number instead of an ascii character!

 Integers are 2 bytes instead of 1 byte and can be negative!

# Commands
 Use > or < to move the index.

 Use + or - to increment or decrement the index.

 Use * to output the index's value.

 Use . to output the index's ascii value.
